# fibonacci

This is a C program to do either of the following:

- Print the nth fibonacci number
- Print the first n terms of a fibonacci sequence
- Write the first n terms of a fibonacci sequence to a file

 ## Motivation

I hadn't written anything in c for a long time and thought this would be a good way to get back into it. <br>
Someone from my college shared this problem statement with me and it caught my attention. <br>
I also wanted to try out development on linux, so this was written entirely using nano on wsl and debugged using gdb. <br>
The file was then further segregated into the folder structure you see on windows as I also wanted to learn how to create and share repositories in a universally accepeted manner. <br>
I did create the header files using using github copilot.
